    "GHOST (General Holistic Organism Scripting Tool) is a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) designed to allow human authors to script behaviors for artificial characters. GHOST is inspired by ChatScript in its syntax, it uses ECAN to guide the context formation and rule discovery processes, OpenPsi for internal dynamics modulation and goal-driven rule (action) selection, as well as various other OpenCog cognitive algorithms for handling a wider range of situations in more flexible and intelligent ways.\n",
